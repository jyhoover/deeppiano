## An AI Powered Piano Composer

1. Before train the model, need to download extra datasets:midi source `maestro-v3.0.0-midi.zip` from https://magenta.tensorflow.org/datasets/maestro to `maestro-v3.0.0/`. The csv file `maestro-v3.0.0.csv` of all the midi pieces has been included in the folder.


2. To train the model, run `deep_piano_console.ipynb`. A suggested platform is Google Colab. There are parameters that can be adjusted. Results will be saved under `result/`
